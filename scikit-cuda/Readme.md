# CUDA Programming 

## Introduction 

The library of scikit-cuda provides Python interfaces to many of the functions in the CUDA 
device/runtime, CUBLAS, CUFFT, and CUSOLVER libraries distributed as part of NVIDIA's CUDA 
Programming Toolkit, as well as interfaces to select functions in the CULA Dense Toolkit. 
Both low-level wrapper functions similar to their C counterparts and high-level functions 
comparable to those in NumPy and Scipy are provided.

## Documentation

Package documentation is available at http://scikit-cuda.readthedocs.org/. Many of the high-
level functions have examples in their docstrings. More illustrations of how to use both 
the wrappers and high-level functions can be found in the demos/ and tests/subdirectories.

## Notes

It is used as a reference while learning and looking up some usage of the CUDA and CUDA for 
Python. It is convenient to involve the introdution and weblink in the folder.
