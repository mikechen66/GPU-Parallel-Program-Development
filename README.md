# GPU Program Development

## Introduction 

CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created 
by Nvidia. It allows software developers to use a CUDA-enabled GPU for general purpose processing
â€“ an approach termed GPGPU (general-purpose computing on graphics processing units). 

## Usage 

The repository not only inlcudes the code from some resources but also the professional documents
and weblinks from Nvidia and other industrial palyers. The one-stop provision will be helpful for 
further learning the GPU-based programming. 

## CUDA Platform 

The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction 
set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels.The CUDA platform 
is designed to work with programming languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. This accessibility 
makes it easier for specialists in parallel programming to use GPU resources. CUDA-powered GPUs 
also support programming frameworks such as OpenMP, OpenACC and OpenCL;and HIP by compiling 
such code to CUDA.
