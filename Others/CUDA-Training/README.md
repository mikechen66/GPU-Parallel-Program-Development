# GPU-Parallel-Program-Development

## Reposiroty

The CUDA platform is designed to work with programming languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. This accessibility makes it easier for specialists in parallel programming to use GPU resources. CUDA-powered GPUs also support programming frameworks such as OpenMP, OpenACC and OpenCL;and HIP by compiling such code to CUDA. Please take the suitable approach to the repository because it was released 4 years ago.

## CUDA Highlight 

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by Nvidia. It allows software developers and software engineers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing â€“ an approach termed GPGPU (general-purpose computing on graphics processing units). The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels. use GPU resources. CUDA-powered GPUs also support programming frameworks such as OpenMP, OpenACC and OpenCL;and HIP by compiling such code to CUDA.
