# GPU Parallel Program Development Using CUDA
Tolga Soyata

## Introduction

The book using CUDA teaches GPU programming by showing the differences among different 
old families of GPUs(neither Amphere nor Turing) since the in-depth GPU jargons. So it
only emphasizes the concept rather than specific platforms. 

## Content

The book consists of three separate parts; it starts by explaining parallelism using CPU
multi-threading in Part One. Part Two introduces GPU massive parallelism. The same programs 
are parallelized on multiple (old) Nvidia GPU platforms and the same performance analysis 
is repeated. Part Three provides pointer for readers who want to expand their horizons. It 
provides a brief introduction to popular CUDA libraries (such as cuBLAS, cuFFT, NPP, and 
Thrust).
