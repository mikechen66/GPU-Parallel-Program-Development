# CUDA Programming
Bruce Fan, YouQi

## Introduction

CUDA is playing the most important role in the high performance computing in the fields of deep learning, physics/chemistry, biology and material science. The book is elementary for the CUDA programming with the environment of CUDA 10.2. Please click the following repositories for reference.

## Repositories

The repository with Python

The repository with C, C++ and CU

## Content

Focus

This book focuses on the CUDA C++ programming with involving neigher the HSA such as OpenCL/OpenACC nor the parallelism the interaction such as OpenGL and Direct3D.

Single GPU

It only involves the scenario of the single GPU. Therefore, it does not inlcude OpenMP and MPI.

NVPROF Profiler

It is necessary to users to adopt the environment of Nvidia nvprof. Other visual profilers are not necessary.

## Resources:

CUDA C Best Practices Guide has the content of more than 400 pages, plus various application libraries and programming development tools in the CUDA toolbox with tens of thousands of pages. Please take the online CUDA resources for reference.
