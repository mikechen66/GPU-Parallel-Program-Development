# CUDA Programming
Bruce Fan, YouQi

CUDA is playing the most important role in the high performance computing in the fields of deep learning, physics/chemistry, biology and material science. The book is elementary for the CUDA programming with the environment of CUDA 10.2. Please click the following repositories for reference.

## CUDA Programming

This book focuses on the CUDA C++ programming with not involving both the HSA such as OpenCL/OpenACC and the parallelism the interaction such as OpenGL and Direct3D.

Single GPU
It only involves the scenario of the single GPU. Therefore, it does not inlcude OpenMP and MPI.

Profiler
It is necessary to users to adopt the environment of Nvidia nvprof. Other visual profilers are not necessary.
