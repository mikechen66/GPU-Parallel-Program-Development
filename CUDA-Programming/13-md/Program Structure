Program Structure 

The holistic structure of the program

main.cu

- Memory allocation and release (memory.cuh, memory.cu)
- initiliaztion of of the simulation system (initialize.cuh and initialize.cu)
- Build the neighbor list (neighbor.cuh and neighbor.cu)
  * Implement the minimum image convention (mic.cuh);
- Integration of movement formula (integrate.cuh and integrate.cu);
  * Get both the force and the potential energy (force.cuh and force.cu)
    & Implement the minimum image convention (mic.cuh)
    
Notes:

clock_t
typedef a-type clock_t;
The type is the arithmetic type a-type of an object that you declare to hold the 
value returned by clock, representing elapsed processor time.
